        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Luiz was born in and grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Luiz began his music studies at the age of 6, starting with classical piano. Three years later, he began his journey into piano competitions around Brazil, and received his first award as one of the finalists in the 5th National Piano Competition of Araçatuba in Dec 1988. His next awards came along just a few years later: finalist in the 7th National Piano Competition of Araçatuba, Dec of 1990; finalist in the 8th National Piano    Competition of Araçatuba, Dec of 1991; 3rd place finalist in the 2nd Coca-Cola Piano Competition, Oct 1992.</p>
        <p>Years later, he discovered his real passion was for popular music and Bossa Nova. Shortly thereafter, he entered the Jazz Piano Program at the Conservatory of Tatui (Sao Paulo-Brazil), improving his skills on improvisation, music arrangement. There he achieved new experiences and music influences in such areas as Bossa Nova, Samba, Reggae, Latin, Blues and Jazz.</p>
        <p>Later on, Luiz moved to China. It didn’t take long before he started working with many highly respected artists, including classical Chinese singers from the Shanghai Opera House – such as Chen Hai Yan – and Jazz bands – including the Rolf Becker Big Band.</p>
